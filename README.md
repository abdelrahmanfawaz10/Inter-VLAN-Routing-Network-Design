# Inter-VLAN-Routing-Network-Design
Inter-VLAN routing implementation using Cisco Packet Tracer, demonstrating VLAN segmentation and router-on-a-stick configuration.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Inter-VLAN Routing** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The network is segmented into multiple VLANs, allowing efficient traffic separation while enabling communication between VLANs through routing.

## Key Concepts Covered
- VLAN Configuration
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- Router-on-a-Stick
- Subinterfaces
- VLAN Trunking

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS

## Network Design
- Multiple VLANs configured on switches
- Trunk link between switch and router
- Subinterfaces configured on the router
- Successful communication between different VLANs

## Screenshots
Screenshots showing VLAN configuration, router subinterfaces, and inter-VLAN connectivity are included in the screenshots folder.

## Outcome
- Proper VLAN segmentation
- Successful inter-VLAN communication
- Scalable network design following best practices
